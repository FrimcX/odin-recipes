    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.

        I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.
